# Dr. Who
Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called "the Doctor", an extraterrestrial being, to all appearances human. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS.
## Who is them?
So who is them: 
* The Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery
* In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence
* He battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine
* The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure
* He was eventually revealed to be a Time Lord

As the doctor says:
>Rule 1: The Doctor lies.
